# Development files

This directory contains intermediate development artifacts that are not part of the final mlkem-native sources.

It is only relevant to you if you are developing mlkem-native or would like to understand the origin
of the assembly source files.

## AArch64 arithmetic assembly

#### Clean

[`aarch64_clean`](aarch64_clean) contains the 'clean' assembly underlying the AArch64 native backend of mlkem-native.
The files in this directory are handwritten and kept readable through the extensive use of register aliases and macros.

#### Optimized

[`aarch64_opt`](aarch64_opt) contains the results of running the SLOTHY superoptimizer on the clean assembly files in [`aarch64_clean`](aarch64_clean).
The optimized sections are 'raw' assembly in the sense that they no longer use register macros or aliases, but the surrounding code (such as the
function preamble and postamble) typically still use those register aliases/macros. Also, the macros and alias
definitions themselves are still kept. See the SLOTHY paper[^SLOTHY_Paper] for more details on SLOTHY.

#### Final

The final AArch64 arithmetic assembly from [mlkem/native/aarch64/src](../mlkem/native/aarch64/src) is auto-generated
from the optimized assembly using the [`simpasm`](../scripts/simpasm) script, which simplifies it through a combination
of assembly+disassembly. This final assembly does not contain any register aliases or macros anymore.

The final assembly is autogenerated from the optimized assembly through the [`autogen`](../scripts/autogen) script.
Non-assembly files are synchronized by copy between this directory and [`mlkem`](../mlkem).

#### Testing clean/optimized assembly

To test the clean assembly, run `autogen --aarch64-clean`. This will import the clean backend into `mlkem/native/aarch64/*`,
replacing the optimized one. With `autogen --aarch64-clean --no-simplify` or `autogen --no-simplify` you can moreover reinstate
the non-simplified assembly in the main source tree.

Alternatively, you can also just manually copy the entire `aarch64_clean` and `aarch64_opt` trees into `mlkem/native/aarch64/`.

## AArch64 FIPS-202 assembly

As for the AArch64 arithmetic assembly, the final FIPS-202 assembly is the result of running [`simpasm`](../scripts/simpasm)
on the assembly in [fips202/aarch64/src](fips202/aarch64/src). Non-assembly files are synchronized by copy.

## x86_64 arithmetic assembly

As for the AArch64 arithmetic assembly, the final x86_64 arithmetic assembly is the result of running [`simpasm`](../scripts/simpasm)
on the assembly in [x86_64/src](x86_64/src). Non-assembly files are synchronized by copy.
